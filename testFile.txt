Data analytics is increasingly being brought to bear to treat human disease, but as more and more health data is stored in computer databases, one significant challenge is how to perform analyses across these disparate databases. In this post I take a look at the Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (or OHDSI, pronounced “Odyssey”) program that was formed to address this challenge, and which today accounts for 1.26 billion patient records collectively stored across 64 databases in 17 countries.

Randomized Controlled Trials and Observational Studies
Consider a researcher who has a new theory they want to test: does aspirin cause bone loss that can lead to osteoporosis? Traditionally, the main instrument for answering questions of this kind has been the randomized controlled trial (RCT). A RCT is an experiment that places the patients in the trial into one of two groups: a group that receives the treatment, and a control group that receives a placebo. By looking at the statistical effect of the treatment compared to the placebo on the outcome, you can learn if the treatment has an effect.
